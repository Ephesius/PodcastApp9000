| Platform | Native Features | Platform Compliance |
| End-to-End | User Scenarios | Feature Validation |

### 3.2 Performance Strategy

```
Performance Optimization Flow:
1. Baseline Establishment
   └── Metric Definition
       └── Data Collection
           └── Analysis
               └── Optimization Implementation
                   └── Validation
                       └── Target Achievement or
                           Return to Analysis
```
