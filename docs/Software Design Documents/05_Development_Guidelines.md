- **Context:** Cross-platform development framework needed
- **Options Considered:**
  - Xamarin.Forms
  - MAUI
  - Flutter
- **Decision:** MAUI
- **Rationale:**
  - Modern .NET support
  - Better Windows integration
  - Improved performance
  - Future-proof technology
  - Better tooling support
- **Consequences:**
  - Limited to platforms MAUI supports
  - Newer framework means less community resources
  - May encounter early-adoption issues

## Architecture Decisions

### Architecture: System Architecture Documentation Approach
- **Date:** 2024-04-23
- **Context:** Need to establish clear architectural documentation that balances detail with maintainability
- **Options Considered:**
  - Implementation-heavy documentation
  - Pure textual descriptions
  - Mixed format approach (tables, diagrams, prose)
  - UML-focused documentation
- **Decision:** Mixed format approach with clear separation of concerns
- **Rationale:**
  - Different aspects of architecture are best expressed in different formats
  - Tables work well for comparisons
  - ASCII diagrams clearly show relationships
  - Prose better explains concepts and decisions
  - Lists work well for responsibilities and features
- **Consequences:**
  - More maintainable documentation
  - Clearer architectural boundaries
  - Better guidance for implementation
  - Easier to review and validate design decisions

### Documentation: Architecture-First Design Documentation
- **Date:** 2024-04-23
- **Context:** Initial design documents mixed high-level architecture with low-level implementation details, making it difficult to maintain a clear separation of concerns and potentially limiting implementation flexibility.
- **Options Considered:**
  - Mixed approach (architecture + implementation)
  - Implementation-focused documentation
  - Architecture-focused documentation
  - Separate documents for each
- **Decision:** Adopt an architecture-focused approach for design documentation, deferring implementation details to the development phase.
- **Rationale:**
  - Clearer separation of concerns
  - Better maintainability of documentation
  - More flexible implementation options
  - Easier to review and validate design decisions
  - Better alignment with system-level thinking
- **Consequences:**
  - More abstract documentation requires careful thought about interfaces
  - Need to maintain separate implementation documentation later
  - Clearer architectural boundaries
  - More flexibility during implementation
  - Better foundation for future changes

### Audio: Platform-Specific Audio Architecture
- **Date:** 2024-04-23
- **Context:** Audio handling between Android and Windows platforms has fundamental differences in both architecture and system integration requirements.
- **Options Considered:**
  - Single cross-platform implementation
  - Platform-specific implementations with common interface
  - Hybrid approach with shared core
  - MAUI-native audio handling
- **Decision:** Implement platform-specific audio handling behind a common interface.
- **Rationale:**
  - Android and Windows have vastly different audio focus and background models
  - Platform-specific media notifications required
  - Different battery optimization considerations
  - Need deep integration with platform-specific media controls
  - Better user experience with native implementations
- **Consequences:**
  - More code to maintain
  - Better native experience on each platform
  - Cleaner architecture
  - More reliable audio handling
  - Better platform integration
  - Increased testing requirements

### Documentation: Development Strategy Structure
- **Date:** 2024-04-23
- **Context:** Initial development strategy document mixed architectural guidance with implementation details, making it difficult to maintain clear strategic direction during development.
- **Options Considered:**
  - Implementation-focused approach with specific code examples
  - High-level overview with minimal structure
  - Structured phase-based approach with clear deliverables
  - Combined approach mixing strategic and tactical details
- **Decision:** Adopt structured phase-based approach with clear deliverables and completion criteria, maintaining architectural focus throughout
- **Rationale:**
  - Provides clear strategic direction without constraining implementation
  - Enables better tracking of progress through distinct phases
  - Maintains consistent level of abstraction
  - Supports platform-specific considerations without implementation details
  - Creates clear boundaries between design and implementation phases
- **Consequences:**
  - More maintainable documentation
  - Clearer development roadmap
  - Implementation teams have more flexibility
  - May require additional implementation-specific documentation later
  - Easier to validate progress against strategic goals

### Architecture: Development Phase Organization
- **Date:** 2024-04-23
- **Context:** Need to organize development effort in a way that addresses key architectural risks early while maintaining clear progression toward MVP
- **Options Considered:**
  - Feature-based phases
  - Layer-based phases
  - Risk-based phases
  - Component-based phases
- **Decision:** Organize into foundation-first phases (Foundation → Audio → Library → Sync → Platform) with explicit integration requirements
- **Rationale:**
  - Addresses critical architectural components early
  - Enables continuous validation of architectural decisions
  - Provides clear dependencies between phases
  - Balances platform-specific and shared components
  - Matches team resource allocation pattern
- **Consequences:**
  - Some features split across multiple phases
  - Clearer architectural progression
  - Better risk management
  - More structured integration points
  - May require more up-front architectural work

### Guidelines: MAUI-Centric Development Guidelines
- **Date:** 2024-04-23
- **Context:** Development guidelines needed clearer focus on MAUI architectural patterns and platform-specific considerations
- **Options Considered:**
  - Generic cross-platform guidelines
  - Framework-agnostic guidelines
  - MAUI-specific guidelines
  - Hybrid approach
- **Decision:** Adopt MAUI-centric guidelines with clear platform-specific considerations
- **Rationale:**
  - Better alignment with chosen framework
  - Clearer guidance for platform-specific implementations
  - More focused architectural patterns
  - Better integration with MAUI lifecycle
  - Improved consistency across development team
- **Consequences:**
  - More specific guidance for development team
  - Clearer platform integration requirements
  - Better architectural consistency
  - More maintainable codebase
  - Easier onboarding for MAUI developers
