# PodcastApp9000: Detailed Design

## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 Podcast Discovery Service

#### Design Pattern
- Implements Provider Pattern with fallback chain
- Uses Observer Pattern for feed health monitoring
- Incorporates Cache-Aside Pattern for search results

#### Key Responsibilities
- Podcast search and metadata retrieval
- Feed validation and health monitoring
- Results caching and rate limiting
- Source provider management

#### Component Interactions

    UI[User Interface] --> DS[Discovery Service]
    DS --> C[Cache]
    DS --> P1[Primary Provider]
    DS --> P2[Secondary Provider]
    DS --> FH[Feed Health Monitor]
    FH --> DB[Database]
```

### 1.2 Audio Playback Engine

#### Design Pattern
- Bridge Pattern for platform-specific implementations
- State Pattern for playback state management
- Observer Pattern for state changes

#### Platform-Specific Considerations

##### Android
- Audio Focus Management
- MediaSession integration
- Foreground service requirements
- Battery optimization handling
- Wake lock management

##### Windows
- AudioGraph system
- SystemMediaTransportControls
- Background process management
- Device change handling

#### Component State Machine
```mermaid

    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Preparing: StartPlayback
    Preparing --> Playing: Ready
    Playing --> Paused: PausePlayback
    Playing --> Buffering: BufferUnderrun
    Buffering --> Playing: BufferReady
    Paused --> Playing: ResumePlayback
    Playing --> [*]: Stop
```

### 1.3 Download Manager

#### Design Pattern
- Command Pattern for download queue
- Strategy Pattern for storage management
- Observer Pattern for progress monitoring

#### Key Responsibilities
- Download queue management
- Network type handling
- Storage space management
- File integrity verification
- Resume capability

#### Component Interactions
```mermaid

    DM[Download Manager] --> Q[Queue Manager]
    DM --> SM[Storage Manager]
    DM --> NM[Network Monitor]
    Q --> W[Worker Pool]
    W --> FS[File System]
    SM --> FS
```

## 2. Data Management

### 2.1 Database Architecture

#### Design Pattern
- Repository Pattern
- Unit of Work Pattern for transactions
- Observer Pattern for change tracking

#### Concurrency Strategy
- Optimistic concurrency for read operations
- Pessimistic locking for critical writes
- Transaction isolation for batch operations

#### Data Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    App[Application Layer] --> R[Repository Layer]
    R --> C[Cache Layer]
    R --> DB[Database Layer]
    R --> S[Sync Manager]
    S --> SF[Sync File]
```

### 2.2 Sync System

#### Design Pattern
- Event Sourcing for change tracking
- CQRS for sync operations
- Saga Pattern for sync process

#### Sync Process Flow
```mermaid

    participant App
    participant SM as Sync Manager
    participant FS as File System
    participant DB as Database
    
    App->>SM: InitiateSync
    SM->>FS: AcquireLock
    SM->>DB: GetUnsynced
    SM->>FS: ReadSyncFile
    SM->>SM: MergeChanges
    SM->>FS: WriteWithBackup
    SM->>DB: UpdateSyncState
```
