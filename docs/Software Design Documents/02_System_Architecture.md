# PodcastApp9000: System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

The PodcastApp9000 architecture is designed around a multi-layer system that prioritizes offline-first functionality, reliable synchronization, and platform-specific audio handling. The system follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns between layers.

### 1.1 Core Technologies

| Component | Technology | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| UI Framework | .NET MAUI | Cross-platform UI capabilities, native performance |
| Language | C# 11 | Modern language features, strong type system |
| Local Storage | Document DB | Offline-first, simple sync model |
| Audio Engine | Platform-specific | Native media capabilities, optimal performance |

### 1.2 External Dependencies

#### Podcast Data Services
- Primary: Podcast Index API
  - Rich metadata support
  - Modern podcast namespace features
  - Rate limit: 360 requests/hour
  
- Secondary: iTunes/Apple Podcasts API
  - Fallback search capability
  - Broad podcast coverage
  - Rate limit: 20 requests/minute

- Direct RSS
  - Final fallback option
  - No rate limits
  - Requires robust feed validation

### 2.1 Layer Responsibilities

#### Presentation Layer
- XAML-based UI components
- Platform-specific UI adaptations
- ViewModel logic and state management
- User interaction handling
- UI state preservation

#### Feature Module Layer
Manages core application features:
- Podcast discovery and search
- Audio playback control
- Library management
- Download management
- Settings and configuration

#### Core Services Layer
Provides platform-agnostic interfaces for:
- Audio playback abstraction
- Platform service integration
- Background task management
- Network operations
- File system operations

#### Data Layer
Handles data persistence and synchronization:
- Document database operations
- File system management
- Sync file handling
- Cache management

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Podcast Discovery System

The discovery system uses a chain-of-responsibility pattern for podcast search:

```
Primary Source → Secondary Source → Direct RSS
     ↓               ↓                ↓
   Cache ←── Validation ───→ Health Monitor
```

Key responsibilities:
1. Source management and fallback
2. Feed validation and health tracking
3. Result caching and rate limiting
4. Metadata normalization

### 3.2 Audio System

Platform-specific implementations share a common interface:

#### Common Interface
- Playback control
- Position tracking
- State management
- Error handling

#### Platform-Specific Implementations:

| Feature | Android | Windows |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Media Session | MediaSession API | SystemMediaTransportControls |
| Background | Foreground Service | Background Process |
| Audio Focus | AudioManager | AudioGraph |
| Battery | Doze Mode Handling | Power Throttling |
| Controls | Notification Controls | System Media Controls |

### 3.3 Sync System

The sync system ensures consistent state across devices through file-based synchronization:

1. Change Detection
   - Track local modifications
   - Generate change deltas
   - Version management

2. Merge Resolution
   - Conflict detection
   - Resolution strategies
   - State reconciliation

3. File System Operations
   - Atomic write operations
   - Lock management
   - Integrity verification

## 4. Data Architecture

### 4.1 Storage Structure

    AppRoot/
    ├── Database/          # Core application data
    ├── Downloads/         # Episode audio files
    ├── Cache/            # Temporary data
    └── Sync/             # Sync state files

### 4.2 Core Entities

#### Podcast Entity
- Feed information and metadata
- Episode collection
- Health monitoring data
- Subscription status

#### Episode Entity
- Audio metadata
- Download state
- Playback position
- Last played date

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 5.1 Security

| Area | Approach |
|------|----------|
| API Security | Secure credential storage, key rotation |
| Download Verification | Checksum validation, source verification |
| Sync Security | File integrity, access control |
| Local Data | Platform security features |

### 5.2 Performance Management

Performance is managed across several dimensions:

1. Resource Usage
   - Memory pooling and caching
   - Storage quota management
   - Battery impact minimization

2. Background Operations
   - Priority-based scheduling
   - Resource-aware execution
   - Battery state adaptation

3. Caching Strategy
   - Multi-level cache
   - Predictive caching
   - Resource-aware eviction

## 6. Platform Integration

### 6.1 Android Integration
- Media session lifecycle management
- Background service handling
- Battery optimization
- System notification integration

### 6.2 Windows Integration
- Media transport controls
- Background process management
- Power management integration
- Audio system integration

## 7. Error Handling

Error handling follows a hierarchical approach:

1. Transient Errors
   - Automatic retry with backoff
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Fallback mechanisms

2. Permanent Errors
   - Graceful degradation
   - User notification
   - State recovery

3. Critical Failures
   - Safe state preservation
   - Diagnostic logging
   - Recovery procedures
